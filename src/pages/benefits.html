      <h2>1. Speed of Construction</h2>
      <p>Modules are manufactured in parallel with site works. Real-world example: a 3,000 sq.ft office block assembled in weeks rather than months.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Up to 60% reduction in overall schedule</li>
        <li>Predictable handover dates</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Lower on-site labour hours</li>
        <li>Reduced material waste</li>
      </ul>
